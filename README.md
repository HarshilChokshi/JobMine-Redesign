# JobMine Redesign
Redesigns of University of Waterloo's previous job matching website, Jobmine, created at Waterloo EngHack. Redesigns created in Photoshop to improve upon Jobmine's user interface and user experience. 

# About this hackathon
Before Waterloo Works (which has its problems) the University of Waterloo used Jobmine as their primary application to carry out the process of connecting employers to co-op students. This includes posting employer jobs and allowing students to view them, setting up interviews, and allowing the employers to rank the students. Jobmine, for the most part, got the functionality right. However when it came to appealing eye catching UI and providing a good user experience for the user, Jobmine was a mess. The purpose of this hackathon project was to design a new and improved version of Jobmine using Photoshop.

# Problems with the old design
Before diving in to create the redesgins, current issues with Jobmime form a UI/UX perspective were brought forward. All areas of improvement found on the current Jobmine design can be found in the Illustrationns-of-current-design.docx file. 

# JobMine Redesigns
Below are the redesigns of Jobmine that improve upon the user interface and user experience.
